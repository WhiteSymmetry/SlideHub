# OpenSlideshare v2

This is an open source slidesharing application.

The previous version of OpenSlideshare was made with CakePHP. And this version is a successor of the previous version and is made with Ruby on Rails 4.

- Searching slides
- i18n
- Responsive design
- Embedded player
- RSS
- Statistics
- Transcript
- Admin Dashboard to overview statistics and edit slides

## Requirements

This application depends on following technologies.

- Amazon S3
- Amazon SQS
- Ubuntu 12 or higher with OpenOffice, xpdf, unoconv and so on

* [Note] Application can be placed at any servers. (Amazon EC2 is NOT required.)

## Preparing Infrastructure

* Create two Amazon S3 buckets (cf. open-slideshare-slides, open-slideshare-images)
* Set CORS policy for bucket that will store the slide decks as follows

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<CORSConfiguration xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
    <CORSRule>
        <AllowedOrigin>*</AllowedOrigin>
        <AllowedMethod>GET</AllowedMethod>
        <AllowedMethod>PUT</AllowedMethod>
        <AllowedMethod>POST</AllowedMethod>
        <AllowedMethod>HEAD</AllowedMethod>
        <AllowedHeader>*</AllowedHeader>
        <ExposeHeader>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</ExposeHeader>
        <MaxAgeSeconds>3000</MaxAgeSeconds>
    </CORSRule>
</CORSConfiguration>
```

* Create SQS queue (cf. open-slideshare-convert) and note the url.
* Installing required packages
 * Clone application on your server and copy files to /tmp/

```
git clone https://github.com/ryuzee/open-slideshare-v2
cp open-slideshare-v2/script/*.sh /tmp/
cd /tmp/
```

 * Edit develop.sh or staging.sh and then set Linux user name and other valiables.
 * Then run the script you've just edited.
 * The script will install all required packages including Ruby environment, nginx, several tools and so on.
 * The script will also create the database on your server. However, if you want to use a database running on other server, you need to create a database by your own.

## Environment Variables

You also need to set several environmental variables as follows.
The easiest way is to add these lines to /etc/environment and restart your server.
The other option is to create `.env` file at application root directory. I recommend you to select the first option.

```
OSS_BUCKET_NAME=[Original file bucket name]
OSS_IMAGE_BUCKET_NAME=[Image bucket name]
OSS_USE_S3_STATIC_HOSTING=[1|0]
OSS_REGION=[ap-northeast-1]
OSS_CDN_BASE_URL=[Set value if you are using CDN]
OSS_SQS_URL=[SQS URL]
OSS_AWS_ACCESS_ID=[Your AWS Access Key if you run app out of AWS]
OSS_AWS_SECRET_KEY=[Your AWS Secret Key if you run app out of AWS]
OSS_SMTP_SERVER=[Your SMTP server]
OSS_SMTP_PORT=[587]
OSS_SMTP_USERNAME=[Your email address]
OSS_SMTP_PASSWORD=[]
OSS_SMTP_AUTH_METHOD=plain
OSS_SECRET_KEY_BASE=[hoge]
OSS_PRODUCTION_HOST=[hoge.example.com]
OSS_ROOT_URL=[http://your_root_url]
```

## Run the app

In the production environment, it's better to add the line below to /etc/rc.local

```
sudo -H -u ubuntu -s bash -c â€˜source /etc/environment ; export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH" ; eval "$(rbenv init -)"; cd /opt/application/current ; bin/bundle exec rake unicorn:start'
```

In the development environment, you can run the app as follows.

```
rake start_dev
```

## Register batch procedure to cron

* Handling uploaded slides (Mandatory)

```
*/1 * * * * /bin/bash -lc 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH" ; eval "$(rbenv init -)"; cd /opt/application/current ; bin/rails runner -e production Batch.execute'
```

* Generating sitemap and send it to Google and Bing (Optional)

```
0 3 * * * /bin/bash -lc 'source /etc/environment ; export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH" ; eval "$(rbenv init -)"; cd /opt/application/current ; bin/rake  sitemap:refresh RAILS_ENV=production'
```
