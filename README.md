# OpenSlideshare v2 [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/ryuzee/open-slideshare-v2/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/ryuzee/open-slideshare-v2)

This is an open source slidesharing application.

The previous version of OpenSlideshare was made with CakePHP. And this version is a successor of the previous version and is made with Ruby on Rails 4.

## Features

- Uploading slides (pptx, pdf)
- Listing slides by category, user and so on
- Showing slide without Flash Player
- Showing slide vertically
- Storing all slides in Amazon S3. Thus terribly scalabale
- Searching slides
- i18n
- Responsive design
- Embedded player
- RSS
- Statistics
- Transcript
- Admin Dashboard to overview statistics and edit slides

## Requirements

This application depends on following technologies.

* Amazon S3
* Amazon SQS
* Ubuntu 12 or higher with OpenOffice, xpdf, unoconv and so on
* [Note] Application can be placed at any servers. (Amazon EC2 is NOT required.)

## Preparing Infrastructure

* Create two Amazon S3 buckets (cf. open-slideshare-slides, open-slideshare-images)
* Set CORS policy for bucket that will store the slide decks as follows

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<CORSConfiguration xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
    <CORSRule>
        <AllowedOrigin>*</AllowedOrigin>
        <AllowedMethod>GET</AllowedMethod>
        <AllowedMethod>PUT</AllowedMethod>
        <AllowedMethod>POST</AllowedMethod>
        <AllowedMethod>HEAD</AllowedMethod>
        <AllowedHeader>*</AllowedHeader>
        <ExposeHeader>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</ExposeHeader>
        <MaxAgeSeconds>3000</MaxAgeSeconds>
    </CORSRule>
</CORSConfiguration>
```

* Create SQS queue (cf. open-slideshare-convert) and note the url.
* Clone application on your server and copy files to /tmp/

```
git clone https://github.com/ryuzee/open-slideshare-v2
cp open-slideshare-v2/script/*.sh /tmp/
cd /tmp/
```

 * Edit develop.sh or staging.sh and then set Linux user name and other variables.
 * Then run the script you've just edited.
 * The script will install all required packages including Ruby environment, nginx, several tools and so on.
 * The script will also create the database on your server. However, if you want to use a database running on other server, you need to create a database by your own.

## Environment Variables

You also need to set several environmental variables as follows.
The easiest way is to add these lines to `/etc/environment` and restart your server.
The other option is to create `.env` file at application root directory. I recommend you to select the first option.

```
OSS_BUCKET_NAME=[Original file bucket name]
OSS_IMAGE_BUCKET_NAME=[Image bucket name]
OSS_USE_S3_STATIC_HOSTING=[1|0]
OSS_REGION=[ap-northeast-1]
OSS_CDN_BASE_URL=[Set value if you are using CDN]
OSS_SQS_URL=[SQS URL]
OSS_AWS_ACCESS_ID=[Your AWS Access Key if you run app out of AWS]
OSS_AWS_SECRET_KEY=[Your AWS Secret Key if you run app out of AWS]
OSS_SMTP_SERVER=[Your SMTP server]
OSS_SMTP_PORT=[587]
OSS_SMTP_USERNAME=[Your email address]
OSS_SMTP_PASSWORD=[Your SMTP Password]
OSS_SMTP_AUTH_METHOD=plain
OSS_SECRET_KEY_BASE=[Your Secret Key Base]
OSS_PRODUCTION_HOST=[hoge.example.com]
OSS_ROOT_URL=[http://your_root_url]
OSS_DB_USERNAME_DEV=[DB Username for Dev]
OSS_DB_PASSWORD_DEV=[DB Password for Dev]
OSS_DB_URL_DEV=[DB URL for Dev]
OSS_DB_USERNAME_TEST=[DB Username for Test]
OSS_DB_PASSWORD_TEST=[DB Password for Test]
OSS_DB_URL_TEST=[DB URL for Test]
OSS_DB_USERNAME=[DB Username for Prod]
OSS_DB_PASSWORD=[DB Password for Prod]
OSS_DB_URL=[DB URL for Prod]
```

## Run the app

In the production environment, it's better to add the line below to /etc/rc.local

```
sudo -H -u ubuntu -s bash -c â€˜source /etc/environment ; export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH" ; eval "$(rbenv init -)"; cd /opt/application/current ; bin/bundle exec rake unicorn:start'
```

In the development environment, you can run the app as follows.

```
rake start_dev
```

## Docker Support

After you build your own Docker image, you can run the app on the Docker as follows.
Before run the app on the Docker, you need to create your own database on the other host to accumulate various data permanently.

```
docker run -d \
  --env OSS_REGION=ap-northeast-1 \
  --env OSS_SQS_URL=https://sqs.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/1234567890/your-sqs-job-name \
  --env OSS_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket-name \
  --env OSS_IMAGE_BUCKET_NAME=your-image-bucket.example.com \
  --env OSS_USE_S3_STATIC_HOSTING=1 \
  --env OSS_AWS_SECRET_KEY=suSh19iTaiO0toroUMa1TamarAnG1Nza \
  --env OSS_AWS_ACCESS_ID=AKINATSUHAHIKARIMONO \
  --env OSS_SECRET_KEY_BASE=z3y1x4w1v5u9t26535abcdefghijklmnopqrstu12345 \
  --env OSS_DB_USERNAME=your-database-user \
  --env OSS_DB_PASSWORD=your-database-password \
  --env OSS_DB_URL=your-database-host \
-P --name oss yourname/imagename
```

## Register batch procedure to cron (If you do not use Docker)

* Handling uploaded slides (Mandatory)

```
*/1 * * * * /bin/bash -lc 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH" ; eval "$(rbenv init -)"; cd /opt/application/current ; bin/rails runner -e production Batch.execute'
```

* Generating sitemap and send it to Google and Bing (Optional)

```
0 3 * * * /bin/bash -lc 'source /etc/environment ; export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH" ; eval "$(rbenv init -)"; cd /opt/application/current ; bin/rake  sitemap:refresh RAILS_ENV=production'
```
